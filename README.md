# GameHub

## Description

Description: The project aims to create a website similar to "Steam" but without the ability to play games. Users will be able to view game characteristics, images, reviews, and ratings, but gameplay will not be available.
Goal: The goal of the project is to provide a platform where users can explore detailed information about games, including their features, images, reviews, and ratings, enhancing their gaming experience by making informed decisions about the games they might be interested in.
